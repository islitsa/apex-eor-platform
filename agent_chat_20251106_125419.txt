Design a pipeline monitoring dashboard that shows:

**Pipeline Status Overview:**
  - rrc_production: complete download, complete parsing -> 16 files, 216,079,924 records
  - rrc_permits: complete download, complete parsing -> 1 files, 168,239 records
  - rrc_completions: complete download, complete parsing -> 29 files, 541,053 records
  - fracfocus: complete download, unknown parsing -> 0 files, 0 records

**Requirements:**
- Show processing stage status for each dataset (download -> extract -> parse -> validate -> load)
- Display file counts, record counts, and data sizes
- Highlight any errors or warnings in the pipeline
- Show last update timestamps
- Make it easy to see what's complete vs in-progress vs failed
- Include data quality metrics where available
- Professional, clean layout - this is for monitoring ETL pipeline health

Total: 4 datasets, 216,789,216 records processed
